# Responsive.Portfolio (Homework 2)

## Description

I was given the project to create a responsive portfolio that can be seen on all types of media. Using Bootstrap as the main component I created a simple layout that included a navigation bar, consistent container and a contact form.

I found quite a few elements challening. The first is understanding the Bootstrap Grid and how to utilize rows/columns so that the placement of my content was where I wanted it to be. I got as close as I could figure out and still struggle with this.

A second challenge was figuring out how to get the site responsive on all mobile devices. I don't think I suceeded in this because I thought Bootstrap helps with media query automatically. I tried to set wrappers, containers and change the media query settings for smaller screens but nothign seemed to work out the way I wanted so I left the layout as is because that was the best option. 

I hope that with more practice and knowledge I can use better elements to not only improve my website aethetically but also make it more responsive so that users can actually see it across multiple devices. I looked into how to complete the form email but as I read how to create one it got complicated because it touched on topics I haven't learned yet.

Though this was a frustrating and challenging assignment I was thrilled when certain things actually worked and I did learn more about formatting, website layout, grid system, and how to customize bootstrap elements.
